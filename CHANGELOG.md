# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Command parameters can now be grouped with double quotes. eg. `<<add-recipe "Banana Sensations">` and `<<move "My Game Object" LocationName>>` (@andiCR)

- You can now add dialogue views to dialogue runner at any time.

- The inspector for Yarn scripts now allows you to change the Project that the script belongs to. (@radiatoryang)

- Yarn script compile errors will prevent play mode.

- The `YarnNode` attribute can be added onto string values to restrict the values to node names. For example:

  ```cs
  YarnProject SomeProject;

  [YarnNode(nameof(SomeProject))]
  string TargetNode; // will take whatever nodes exist in the linked project

  DialogueRunner SomeRunner;

  [YarnNode(nameof(SomeRunner))]
  string TargetNode2; // will refer to whatever the runner has loaded currently
  ```

### Changed

- Updated to support new error handling in Yarn Spinner. 
  - Yarn Spinner longer reports errors by throwing an exception, and instead provides a collection of diagnostic messages in the compiler result. In Unity, Yarn Spinner will now show _all_ error messages that the compiler may produce.

- The console will no longer report an error indicating that a command is "already defined" when a subclass of a MonoBehaviour that has `YarnCommand` methods exists. 

- `LocalizedLine.Text`'s setter is now public, not internal.

- `DialogueRunner` will now throw an exception if a dialogue view attempts to select an
  option on the same frame that options are run.

- `DialogueRunner.VariableStorage` can now be modified at runtime.

- Calling `DialogueRunner.StartDialogue` when the dialogue runner is already running will now result in an error being logged.

### Removed

## [v2.0.0-beta5] 2021-08-17

### Added

* `InMemoryVariableStorage` now throws an exception if you attempt to get or set a variable whose name doesn't start with `$`.
* `LineView` now has an onCharacterTyped event that triggers for each character typed in the typewriter effect.

### Changed

* `OptionsListView` no longer throws a `NullPointerException` when the dialogue starts with options (instead of a line.) 
* When creating a new Yarn Project file from the Assets -> Create menu, the correct icon is now used.
* Updated to use the new type system in Yarn Spinner 2.0-beta5.

### Removed

* Yarn Programs: The 'Convert Implicit Declarations' button has been temporarily removed, due to a required compatibility change related to the new type system. It will be restored before final 2.0 release.

## [v2.0.0-beta4] 2021-04-01

Yarn Spinner 2.0 Beta 4 is a hotfix release for Yarn Spinner 2.0 Beta 3. 

### Changed 

- Fixed an issue that caused Yarn Spinner to not compile on Unity 2018 or Unity 2019.

## [v2.0.0-beta3] 2021-03-27

### Added

- The dialogue runner can now be configured to log less to the console, reducing the amount of noise it generates there. (@radiatoryang)
- Warning messages and errors now appear to help users diagnose two common problems: (1) not adding a Command properly, (2) can't find a localization entry for a line (either because of broken line tag or bad connection to Localization Database) (@radiatoryang)
- Made options that have a line condition able to be presented to the player, but made unavailable.
- This change was made in order to allow games to conditionally present, but disallow, options that the player can't choose. For example, consider the following script:

```
TD-110: Let me see your identification.
-> Of course... um totally not General Kenobi and the son of Darth Vader.
    Luke: Wait, what?!
    TD-110: Promotion Time!
-> You don't need to see his identification. <<if $learnt_mind_trick is true>>
    TD-110: We don't need to see his identification.
```

- If the variable `$learnt_mind_trick` is false, a game may want to show the option but not allow the player to select it (i.e., show that this option could have been chosen if they'd learned how to do a mind trick.)
- In previous versions of Yarn Spinner, if a line condition failed, the entire option was not delivered to the game. With this change, all options are delivered, and the `OptionSet.Option.IsAvailable` variable contains `false` if the condition was not met, and `true` if it was (or was not present.)
- The `DialogueUI` component now has a "showUnavailableOptions" option that controls the display behaviour of unavailable options. If it's true, then unavailable options are presented, but not selectable; if it's false, then unavailable options are not presented at all (i.e. same as Yarn Spinner 1.0.)
- Audio for lines in a `Localization` object can now be previewed in the editor. (@radiatoryang)
- Lines can be added to a `Localization` object at runtime. They're only stored in memory, and are discarded when gameplay ends.
- Commands that take a boolean parameter now support specifying that parameter by its name, rather than requiring the string `true`.
- For example, if you have a command like this:

```csharp
  [YarnCommand("walk")]
  void WalkToPoint(string destinationName, bool wait = false) {
    // ...
  }
```

Previously, you'd need to use this in your Yarn scripts:

```
<<walk MyObject MyDestination true>>
```

With this change, you can instead say this:

```
<<walk MyObject MyDestination wait>>
```

- New icons for Yarn Spinner assets have been added.
- New dialogue views, `LineView` and `OptionListView`, have been added. These are intended to replace the previous `DialogueUI`, make use of TextMeshPro for text display, and allow for easier customisation through prefabs.
- `DialogueRunner`s will now automatically create and use an `InMemoryVariableStorage` object if one isn't provided.
- The Inspector for `DialogueRunner` has been updated, and is now easier to use.

### Changed

- Certain private methods in `DialogueUI` have changed to protected, making it easier to subclass (@radiatoryang)
- Fixed an issue where option buttons from previous option prompts could re-appear in later prompts (@radiatoryang)
- Fixed an issue where dialogue views that are not enabled were still being waited for (@radiatoryang)
- Upgrader tool now creates new files on disk, where needed (for example, .yarnproject files)
- `YarnProgram`, the asset that stores references to individual .yarn files for compilation, has been renamed to `YarnProject`. Because this change makes Unity forget any existing references to "YarnProgram" assets, **when upgrading to this version, you must set the Yarn Project field in your Dialogue Runners again.**
- `Localization`, the asset that mapped line IDs to localized data, is now automatically generated for you by the `YarnProject`. 
  - You don't create them yourselves, and you no longer need to manually refresh them. 
  - The `YarnProject` always creates at least one localization: the "Base" localization, which contains the original text found in your `.yarn` files. 
  - You can create more localizations in the `YarnProject`'s inspector, and supply the language code to use and a `.csv` file containing replacement strings.
- Renamed the 'StartHere' demo to 'Intro', because it's not actually the first step in installing Yarn Spinner.
- Simplified the workflow for working with Addressable Assets.
  - You now import the package, enable its use on your Yarn Project, and click the Update Asset Addresses button to ensure that all assets have an address that Yarn Spinner knows about.
- The 3D, VisualNovel, and Intro examples have been updated to use the new `LineView` and `OptionsListView` components, rather than `DialogueUI`.
- `DialogueRunner.ResetDialogue` is now marked as Obsolete (it had the same effect as just calling `StartDialogue` anyway.)
- The `LineStatus` enum's values have been renamed, to better convey their purpose:
  - `Running` is now `Presenting`.
  - `Interrupted` remains the same.
  - `Delivered` is now `FinishedPresenting`.
  - `Ended` is now `Dismissed` .
- The `ResetDialogue()` method now takes an optional parameter to restart from. If none is provided, the dialogue runner attempts to restart from the start node, followed by the current node, or else throws an exception.
- `DialogueViewBase.MarkLineComplete`, the method for signalling that the user wants to interrupt or proceed to the next line, has been renamed to `ReadyForNextLine`.
- `DialogueRunner.continueNextLineOnLineFinished` has been renamed to `automaticallyContinueLines`.

### Removed

- `LocalizationDatabase`, the asset that stored references to `Localization` assets and manages per-locale line lookups, has been removed. This functionality is now handled by `YarnProject` assets. You no longer supply a localization database to a `DialogueRunner` or to a `LineProvider` - the work is handled for you.
- `AddressableAudioLineProvider` has been removed. `AudioLineProvider` now works with addressable assets, if the package is installed and your Yarn Project has been configured to use them.
- You no longer specify a list of languages available to your project in the Preferences menu or in the project settings. This is now controlled from the Yarn Project.
- The `StartDialogue()` method (with no parameters) has been removed. Instead, provide a node name to start from when calling `StartDialogue(nodeName)`.

## [v2.0.0-beta2] 2021-01-14

### Added

- InMemoryVariableStorage now shows the current state of variables in the Inspector. (@radiatoryang)
- InMemoryVariableStorage now supports saving variables to file, and to PlayerPrefs. (@radiatoryang)

### Changed

- Inline expressions (for example, `One plus one is {1+1}`) are now expanded.
- Added Help URLs to various classes. (@radiatoryang)
- The Upgrader window (Window -> Yarn Spinner -> Upgrade Scripts) now uses the updated
  Yarn Spinner upgrade tools. See Yarn Spinner 2.0.0-beta2 release notes for more
  information on the upgrader.
- Fixed an issue where programs failed to import if a source script reference is invalid
- Fixed an issue where the DialogueUI would show empty lines when showCharacterName is
  false and the line has no character name

### Removed

- The `[[Destination]]` and `[[Option|Destination]]` syntax has been removed from the language.
  - This syntax was inherited from the original Yarn language, which itself inherited it from Twine. 
  - We removed it for four reasons: 
    - it conflated jumps and options, which are very different operations, with too-similar syntax; 
    - the Option-destination syntax for declaring options involved the management of non-obvious state (that is, if an option statement was inside an `if` branch that was never executed, it was not presented, and the runtime needed to keep track of that);
    - it was not obvious that options accumulated and were only presented at the end of the node;
    - finally, shortcut options provide a cleaner way to present the same behaviour.
  - We have added a `<<jump Destination>>` command, which replaces the `[[Destination]]` jump syntax.
  - No change to the bytecode is made here; these changes only affect the compiler.
  - Instead of using ``[[Option|Destination]]`` syntax, use shortcut options instead. For example:

```
// Before
Kim: You want a bagel?
[[Yes, please!|GiveBagel]]
[[No, thanks!|DontWantBagel]]

// After
Kim: You want a bagel?
-> Yes, please!
  <<jump GiveBagel>>
-> No, thanks!
  <<jump DontWantBagel>>
```

- InMemoryVariableStorage no longer manages 'default' variables (this concept has moved to the Yarn Program.) (@radiatoryang)

## [v2.0.0-beta1] 2020-10-19

### Added

- Added a 3D speech bubble sample, for dynamically positioning a speech bubble above a game character. (@radiatoryang)
- Added a phone chat sample. (@radiatoryang)
- Added a visual novel template. (@radiatoryang)
- Added support for voice overs. (@Schroedingers-Cat)
- Added a new API for presenting and managing lines of dialogue.
- Added a new API for working with localizations.
- Added an option to DialogueUI to allow hiding character names.
- The Yarn Spinner Window (Window -> Yarn Spinner) now shows the current version of Yarn Spinner.

### Changed

- Individual `.yarn` scripts are now combined into a single 'Yarn Program', which is what you provide to your `DialogueRunner`. You no longer add multiple `.yarn` files to a DialogueRunner. To create a new Yarn Program, open the Asset menu, and choose Create -> Yarn Spinner -> Yarn Program. You can also create a new Yarn Program by selecting a Yarn Script, and clicking Create New Yarn Program.
- Version 2 of the Yarn language requires variables to be declared. You can declare them in your .yarn scripts, or you can declare them in the Inspector for your Yarn Program.
  - Variables must always have a defined type, and aren't allowed to change type. This means, for example, that you can't store a string inside a variable that was declared as a number.
  - Variables also have a default value. As a result, variables are never allowed to be `null`.
  - Variable declarations can be in any part of a Yarn script. As long as they're somewhere in the file, they'll be used.
  - Variable declarations don't have to be in the same file as where they're used. If the Yarn Program contains a script that has a variable declaration, other scripts in that Program can use the variable.
  - To declare a variable on a Yarn Program, select it, and click the `+` button to create the new variable. 
  - To declare a variable in a script, use the following syntax:
  
```
<<declare $variable_name = "hello">> // declares a string
<<declare $variable_name = 123>> // declares a number
<<declare $variable_name = true>> // declares a boolean
```

- Nicer error messages when the localized text for a line of dialogue can't be found.
- DialogueUI is now a subclass of DialogueViewBase.
- Moved Yarn Spinner classes into the `Yarn.Unity` namespace, or one of its children, depending on its purpose.
- Dialogue.AddFunction now uses functions that can take multiple parameters. You no longer use a single `Yarn.Value[]` parameter; you can now have up to 5, which can be strings, integers, floats, doubles, bools, or `Yarn.Value`s.
- Commands registered via the `YarnCommand` attribute can now take parameter types besides strings. Parameters can also be optional. Additionally, these methods are now cached, and are faster to call.

### Removed
- Commands registered via the `YarnCommand` attribute can no longer accept a `params` array of parameters. If your command takes a variable number of parameters, use optional parameters instead.

## [v1.2.7] 

### Changed

- Backported check for Experimental status of AssetImporter (promoted in 2020.2)

## [v1.2.6]

Note: Versions 1.2.1 through 1.2.5 are identical to v1.2.0; they were version number bumps while we were diagnosing an issue in OpenUPM.

### Changed

- Fixed compiler issues in Unity 2019.3 and later by adding an explicit reference to YarnSpinner.dll in YarnSpinnerTests.asmdef

## [v1.2.0] 2020-05-04

This is the first release of v1.2.0 of Yarn Spinner for Unity as a separate project. Previously, this project's source code was part of the Yarn Spinner repository. Version 1.2.0 of Yarn Spinner contains an identical release to this.

### Added

- Yarn scripts now appear with Yarn Spinner icon. (@Schroedingers-Cat)
- Documentation is updated to reflect the current version number (also to mention 2018.4 LTS as supported)
- Added a button in the Inspector for `.yarn` files in Yarn Spinner for Unity, which updates localised `.csv` files when the `.yarn` file changes. (@stalhandske, https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/issues/227)
- Added handlers for when nodes begin executing (in addition to the existing handlers for when nodes complete.) (@arendhil, https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/issues/222)
- `OptionSet.Option` now includes the name of the node that an option will jump to if selected.
- Added unit tests for Yarn Spinner for Unity (@Schroedingers-Cat)
- Yarn Spinner for Unity: Added a menu item for creating new Yarn scripts (Assets -> Create -> Yarn Script)
- Added Nuget package definitions for [YarnSpinner](http://nuget.org/packages/YarnSpinner/) and [YarnSpinner.Compiler](http://nuget.org/packages/YarnSpinner.Compiler/).

### Changed

- Fixed a crash in the compiler when parsing single-character commands (e.g. `<<p>>`) (https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/issues/231)
- Parse errors no longer show debugging information in non-debug builds.
