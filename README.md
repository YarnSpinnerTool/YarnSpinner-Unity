[Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) is the friendly tool for writing dialogue in games. It's easy for writers to use, and has powerful features for programmers.

Yarn Spinner is a dialogue system that lets you write interactive conversations in a simple, screenplay-like format, which can be loaded into your game and run. 

When a conversation is running, Yarn Spinner sends your game **lines** of dialogue to show, **options** to let the player choose from, and **commands** to make things happen in your scene. 

Yarn Spinner has been used in thousands of amazing games, including [Night in the Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com), [A Short Hike](https://ashorthike.com), [Lost in Random](https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/lost-in-random), [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game/), [Frog Detective](https://frogdetective.net/), [Button City](https://www.buttoncitygame.com/), [Escape Academy](https://escapeacademygame.com/en), [Baladins](https://www.baladinsgame.com/), and [Unbeatable](https://www.unbeatablegame.com/).
